Jordan Knight has a net worth of $18 million.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Knight was born on May 17, 1970 in Worcester, Massachusetts. His parents are both from Ontario, Canada and he holds dual Canadian-American citizenship. He is the youngest of six total children and was raised in a religious home as his parents are both Episcopal priests.</p><p>When he was young, Knight played on a baseball league, though he did not experience much success and was often bulled for his lack of athleticism.</p><h2 id=new-kids-on-block><strong>New Kids on the Block</strong></h2><p>In 1984, when Knight was 14, his friend <a href=# title="Donnie Wahlberg Net Worth">Donnie Wahlberg</a> recruited him to join a band that he had recently started called New Kids on the Block. The band was the brainchild of agent/producer <a href=# title="Maurice Starr Net Worth">Maurice Starr</a>. Knight joined along with this older brother Jonathan and a couple other members. The band was signed to Columbia Records and released their self-titled debut album in 1986. The first two singles off the album did not receive much airplay but the band was able to secure a deal for a second album due to Starr's diligence.</p><p>Dissatisfied with the overly pop sound of their first album, the members of the band, including Knight, decided they wanted more input into how their second album sounded. Knight secured an associate producer credit on the album, called "Hangin' Tough," which went on to experience significantly more success than their first after its release at the end of 1988. The first single off the album, "Please Don't Go Girl," climbed to number ten on the Billboard's Hot 100 Singles Chart. Their second and third singles launched the band into popularity and they were soon touring to sold-out shows. By the end of 1989, the album had reached the number one spot on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart and had gone eight-times platinum.</p><p>New Kids on the Block continued growing in popularity throughout the beginning of the 1990s. They had a massive fan club, played over 200 shows per year, and had multiple number one singles. However, their third album in 1994 failed to live up to commercial expectations and their popularity began to decline. Knight's older brother Jonathan decided to leave the band in the mid-1990s due to increasing panic attacks which led to the official break-up of the group.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-208763 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/jordan-Knight.jpg alt="Jordan Knight Net Worth" width=594 height=382 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-208763 class=wp-caption-text>Ethan Miller/Getty Images</p><h2 id=solo-career-other-pursuits><strong>Solo Career and Other Pursuits</strong></h2><p>Following New Kids on the Block's disbandment, Knight was quiet for some time before launching his solo career in 1999.
