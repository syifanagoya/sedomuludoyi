Her mother supported her recovery from these violent acts and encouraged her to be involved in the community.</p><p>According to her biography Tatana states that these experiences inspired her to work to improve the lives of girls who undergo extreme hardships. During her teenager, she became involved in working to improve the lives of young girls living in marginalized communities.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tarana-burke-education></span><span>Tarana Burke Education</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tatana attended Alabama State University then transferred and graduated from Auburn University.

She says that Catholicism was a place, a way for her to gauge how to exist in the world. Inside of this trauma, there was hope.”</p><p>Tarana ‘s faith has been a part her life since she was a child. She was brought up in an interfaith home. Tarana’s brother and stepfather were Muslim.&nbsp; After attending Catholic schools most of her childhood, she decided to become Catholic. In her seventh grade, she received her first Communion and was confirmed.</p><p>Growing up in an interfaith home gave Tarana a chance to explore her Catholic faith and Islam simultaneously. “There was a lot of debate in the house about religion,” she says, adding that it allowed her understanding of Christianity to grow. While growing up she also loved the structure of Catholicism , adding that she loved having what she described as “hard-and-fast rules that said, you do this, you’re good, you don’t do this, you’re not good.” However, Tarana eventually moved away from Catholicism after her grandfather began teaching her about the Catholic Church’s history. After she learnt about the church’s slave-holding past, she could no longer reconcile her faith and her identity.</p><p class=after-ad>Tarana is still Christian though she no longer identifies as Catholic — and faith is still a pivotal part of the work that she does. In 1997, Ms. Burke founded Just Be Inc, a nonprofit organization focused on helping young girls who have been victims of sexual harassment and assault. “My professional life is motivated by my personal life. My personal life is grounded in my faith,” she tells me. “You can’t do this kind of work without being grounded in a faith that showed possibilities. Christianity is, really, when you take away all the pomp and circumstance, it’s about hope and possibility.”</p><p>In 2018, she attended the&nbsp;75th Golden Globe Awards&nbsp;as a guest of&nbsp;Michelle Williams.[&nbsp;Burke received the 2018 Prize for Courage from&nbsp;The Ridenhour Prizes, which is awarded to individuals who demonstrate courageous defense of the public interest and passionate commitment to social justice, for popularizing the phrase “me too” as a way to empathize with sexual assault survivors more than a decade ago.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tarana-burke-me-too-tarana-burke-me-too-movement></span><span>Tarana Burke Me Too | Tarana Burke Me Too Movement</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tarana founded the Me Too movement in 2006. She began using the phrase “Me Too” to raise awareness of the pervasiveness of sexual abuse and assault in society. The phrase “Me Too” developed into a broader movement following the 2017 use of #MeToo as a hashtag following the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations.</p><p>In October 2017, actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women to say “Me Too” if they’ve experienced sexual harassment or assault, and the hashtag went viral. Milano quickly acknowledged Burke’s earlier use of the phrase on Twitter, writing “I was just made aware of an earlier #MeToo movement, and the origin story is equal parts heartbreaking and inspiring”. Burke has been supportive of the #MeToo hashtag.</p><p>Time named Burke, among a group of other prominent activist women dubbed “the silence breakers”, as the Time Person of the Year for 2017. Her speaking engagements have included Brown University in February 2018.</p><p>Currently Tarana is a Senior Director at Girls for Gender Equity.&nbsp; She organizes workshops to help improve policies at schools, workplaces, and places of worship.&nbsp; She&nbsp; focuses on helping victims not blame themselves for sexual violence.

Kelly</strong>, following years of allegations from women who say the singer sexually and emotionally abused them.</p><p>Families of several women over the past years have come forward accusing R Kelly of keeping their loved ones as sex slaves.&nbsp; In 2018 the attorney of one woman presented evidence&nbsp;to the Dallas County district attorney’s office in the hopes of generating an indictment.</p><p>Jerhonda Pace, who met the R Kelly&nbsp; when she was 15 and is now in her twenties, described&nbsp;her experiences on the talk show&nbsp;The Real. “He would slap you in your face, and he would physically like harm you,” Pace said. “He would put you in a room, and he would lock you in the room for days.”</p><p>In response to the allegations, an online campaign called #MuteRKelly launched last year. It has gained widespread visibility since Time’s Up publicly&nbsp;joined in&nbsp;on Monday, supported by several influential women in entertainment — including director Ava DuVernay, television producer and writer Shonda Rhimes and actress Lupita Nyong’o.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tarana-burke-website></span><span>Tarana Burke Website</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her website name is Me Too Movement – official website</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tarana-burke-ted-talk></span><span>Tarana Burke Ted Talk</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>An inspiring, honest talk: Tarana was consumed by a desire to do something about the sexual violence she saw in her community in 2006 . She took out a piece of paper, wrote “Me Too” across the top and laid out an action plan for a movement centered on the power of empathy between survivors.</p><p>More than a decade later, she reflects on what has since become a global movement&nbsp; and makes a powerful call to dismantle the power and privilege that are building blocks of sexual violence. “We owe future generations nothing less than a world free of sexual violence,” she says. “I believe we can build that world.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tarana-burke-time-magazine></span><span>Tarana Burke Time Magazine</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In 2017 Tarana was named Time Magazine’s Person of the Year.

I’m in service to people, I’m in service to God, and that’s what drives it.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tarana-burke-social-media></span><span>Tarana Burke Social Media</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tarana started a&nbsp; Social media movement 2 wds. crossword clue answers and solutions which was last seen today at the popular Daily Themed Crossword puzzle.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tarana-burke-book></span><span>Tarana Burke Book</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span role=heading>Where the Light Enters: The Founding of the ‘Me Too’ Movement</span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tarana-burke-twitter></span><span>Tarana Burke Twitter</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by TaranaBurke</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tarana-burke-instagram></span><span>Tarana Burke Instagram</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fqa6zrc2aZJutoqCybq7IqJ6rmaCdxm6txp5kqZmimru1v4yhrKyakaOxbrnEZquop12ivLexzJ6lrWWRo7Fuv86coJqkXaKypbXAaA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./fai-khadra-not-dating-kylie-jenner-relationship.html>&#171;&nbsp;Fai Khadra Is Not Dating Kylie Jenner</a>
