To the public, Nick Carter is perhaps best known for his involvement with the popular vocal group called “<a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a>”. Formed in 1993, the band also included <a href=#>AJ McLean</a>, <a href=#>Howie Dorough</a>, <a href=#>Kevin Richardson</a> and <a href=#>Brian Littrell</a>. The “<a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a>” rose to prominence in 1996 with the release of their self-titled studio album, which brought them a lot of international attention. In addition to producing five singles, the album managed to top the music charts in Austria, Canada, Germany and Malaysia. The group followed their successful debut with “Backstreet’s Back”, and “<a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a>”, both of which came out in 1997. The latter self-titled album was released solely in the United States, where it enjoyed large commercial success. “<a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a>” attracted public attention with such singles as “Everybody (<a href=#>Backstreet’s</a> Back)”, “As Long As You Love Me”, and “All I Have to Give”, all of which contributed to the sales of the album. Up to date, the album has sold approximately 14 million copies, and earned a 14-times Platinum certification. Since their debut, both internationally and in the United States, “<a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a>” have grown to become one of the best-selling groups in music history, with more than 130 million albums sold around the world. More recently, in 2013, in order to celebrate their 20th anniversary the band released their eighth studio album called “In a World Like This”.</p><h3>Nick Carter Net Worth $35 Million</h3><p>A member of the popular “<a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a>” group, how rich is Nick Carter? According to sources, Nick’s net worth is estimated to be $35 million, most of his wealth coming from his singing career.</p><p>Nick Carter was born in 1980, in New York, United States. Carter started his career as a teenager, yet his primary focus was to become an actor. As a result of this, Carter attended various auditions, and landed several roles on television commercials. One of Carter’s most significant roles at the time was an appearance in <a href=#>Tim Burton</a>’s dark fantasy film called “Edward Scissorhands”, with <a href=#>Johnny Depp</a> and <a href=#>Winona Ryder</a>. Carter’s career took a different turn when he joined “<a href=#>Backstreet Boys</a>” and began performing on stage. Even though Nick Carter is best known as a member of the group, he also managed to release two solo albums, namely “Now or Never” and “I’m Taking Off”. “Now or Never” came out in 2002, and enjoyed a fair amount of success and media attention. Upon its release, it peaked at #17 on the Billboard 200 music chart, and managed to sell over 550,000 copies in the United States. Carter’s most recent solo venture was released in 2011 under his own label “Kaotic INC”. The album featured a hit song “Just One Kiss”, which significantly contributed to the overall success of the album.</p><p>Carter returned to television screens in 2006, with his own reality series called “House of Carters”, which aired for one season.</p><p>A well-known singer, Nick Carter has an estimated net worth of $35 million.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=22.110429447853><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Nick Carter</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$35 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$35 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 28, 1980</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Jamestown, New York, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft (1.83 m)</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Singer-songwriter, Dancer, Record producer, Author, Music Video Director, Musician, Entertainer</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Lauren Kitt (m. 2014)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Odin Reign Carter</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Parents</td><td>Robert Gene Carter, Jane Elizabeth Carter</td></tr><tr readability=9><td>Siblings</td><td>Aaron Carter, Leslie Carter, Angel Carter, Bobbie Jean Carter, Taelyn Carter, Kaden Brent Carter, Virginia Carter</td></tr><tr readability=10><td>Nicknames</td><td>Nickolas Gene Carter , Chaos , Messy Marvin , Frack , Nicky , BackStreet Boys , The Backstreet Boys , Nickolas Gene "Nick" Carter</td></tr><tr readability=0.38095238095238><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.facebook.com/NickCarter</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.twitter.com/nickcarter</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.40909090909091><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.instagram.com/nickcarter</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.35><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.myspace.com/nickcarter</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm0141853</a></td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Music Groups</td><td>Backstreet Boys (Since&nbsp;1993), NKOTBSB, Bravo All Stars (1998)</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>TV Shows</td><td>House of Carters, Dancing with the Stars</td></tr></table><table class=quotes readability=19.201061320755><tr><th>#</th><th>Quote</th></tr><tr readability=3><td>1</td><td>I don't believe in being mean to anyone.
